* behave tests for behave-core

  Eat own dogfood.

* Running tests (as a user)

  Hopefully no steps are necessary since we're just testing core.

** Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

  Starting from the behave-core root directory, using Ubuntu 12.04.

  Setup the python environment in the right place.

  : sudo apt-get -u install python-virtualenv
  : cd tests
  : virtualenv `pwd`
  : source bin/activate
  : pip install behave
  : pip install selenium
  : pip install jsonpath-rw

  Running all tests (the *.feature files) should be as simple as:

  : behave

  Or against the UI/server target of your choice:

  : TARGET=http://localhost:8989 behave
